**TRY Contagion Analysis**

This project investigates whether Turkish Lira (TRY) crisis events generate financial contagion effects across emerging market currencies (BRL, MXN, ZAR), Turkish equities (BIST 100), and European-linked financial exposure.

Using daily return data (2018–2025), the notebook applies:

- Correlation and rolling correlation analysis

- Crisis-window comparisons (±5 days around >3% TRY depreciation shocks)

- T-tests on rolling correlations

- Event study methodology with Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR)

**Preliminary Findings**

Baseline correlations between TRY and other EM currencies are generally low.

MXN shows statistically higher rolling correlations during crisis windows.

BRL and BIST show marginal significance in correlation tests.

Event study results indicate statistically significant negative abnormal returns for BIST during TRY crises, while EM FX effects remain weak or insignificant.

**The analysis is ongoing, with further robustness testing and causal controls to be added.**
